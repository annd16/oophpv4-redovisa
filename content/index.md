About me
=========================

[FIGURE src="image/me_538x788.png?w=200" caption="Picture of me"]

This is my me-webpage in the programming course [oophp](https://dbwebb.se/oophp). My name is Anna and I live in Stockholm. I have earlier studied within the area of natural science. After I finished my studies, I worked for several years within the manufacturing industry. One of many tasks in my work was to create 'control files' for some of the equipments I were in charge of, which I found very fulfilling. The hobbies I have engaged in, have varied throughout the years, but I have always had an interest in computers and in programming, at least in theory!
